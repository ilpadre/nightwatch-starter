# nightwatch-starter
Very basic files for a nightwatch.js project. 

After cloning, follow these steps:

1. Install the nightwatch module

    npm i nightwatch --save-dev

2. Install chromedriver 

    npm i chromedriver --save-dev

3. Run tests

    npm test


You're now ready to start writing tests. You can add tests to the firstTest.js file in the tests 
folder or you can delete firstTest.js and replace it with your own.
